As 13:38 at Mar 27, there are 3 wildcard remained to debug
but those are very tough, considering Friday is the test,
I decide to concentrare on that. 
Those 3 bugs is tough because it need restructure, the easiest way I can imagine is to 
find all punctuations and replace it with space. After changed, replace the punctuaton again. 

But previously, I classified by using space, I should mention this before too late. 

So I decide to end here, hope it can earn an average grade.
